Title: Assimilate!

Theme: Two Button Controls and/or Growth (We went for both!)

Concept: You play as a blob that is out to consume everything in sight! Absorb smaller objects to grow larger!

Gameplay: Character movement takes place via a joystick (since it technically isn't a button), and the blob can jump and dash using two corresponding action buttons. The player will win the level once they have reached a certain size, though they will have a predetermined amount of time in which to reach said size. The blob can only consume objects smaller than itself, and certain objects and hazards will cause the blob to decrease in size. Various power-up items may/will (time permitting) cause various positive effects like increasing the blob's size greatly, affecting jump height or dash speed, or even changing the state of the blob to use new abilities!

Stretch goals:
  -More than one level.
  -Absorbed resources float inside the player.
